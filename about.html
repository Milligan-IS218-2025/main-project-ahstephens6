        <p>
            I am an undergraduate computer science and cybersecurity double major. I am also part 
            of the Milligan University bowling team, where I travel around the east coast and midwest United states to compete.
            I am a work study for the computer science area, and a teacher's assistant for a C++ engineering class.

            I have been keeping saltwater aquariums for about 5 years.
            I keep two tanks at home right now, one is 30 gallons, and the other is 90 gallons.
            I keep fish, corals, and anemones and have had good success growing and propagating them.
            This hobby has been a passion of mine for a long time now, and I am excited to explore ways to further my knowledge and
            advancement of the hobby.
