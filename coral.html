        <h1>Coral Overview</h1>
    </header>
    <article id="firstheading">
        <p>
            Coral have three main categories: Small Polyp Stony (SPS), Large Polyp Stony (LPS),
            and Soft coral. Each of these have unique lighting and flow requirements, but
            generally have the same what chemistry requirements. The following sections will
            provide lighting arrangements and flow arrangements based on each type of coral. Some
            coral will differ from the norm and I will link to more information about them when
            they come up. I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you research more in depth the
            specific coral you are looking at before purchasing it to ensure you can provide the best
            environment for it. Flow is something you will have to experiment with, however, you can 
            rent a tool called a par meter, to measure the light output in specific areas of the tank.

        <header>
            <h2>Small Polyp Stony (SPS)</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                SPS coral can be broken down into 2 categories: acropora, and not acropora.
                In general, acropora all of have the same lighting and flow requirements, whereas
                the rest of SPS have different requirements. In general these corals should be placed
                on or near the top of the rock structure in the tank so that they receive the correct
                flow and lighting conditions.
            </p>
        </header>
            <section class="left">
                <h4>Acropora</h4>
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rKukcy4vSss" frameborder="0"allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                    The care requirements for acropora are that they need high light and high flow. High light 
                    is anything about 200 par and above. High flow will require some experimentation, however 
                    the key is that the flow should be turbulent and indirect. There should not be a pump 
                    pointed directly at a coral as this could damage it.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="right">
                <h4>Non acropora</h4>
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3OISdJ6zMk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                    The care requirements for non acropora coral is much easier. They generally 
                    require medium lighting and medium flow. Medium light is anything between 125 and 175 par.
                    Once again, flow will be something you will have to experiment with in order to get right,
                    but it should be much gentler than for acropora.
                </p>

        <header>
            <h2>Large Polyp Stony (LPS)</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                LPS corals have a fairly straight forward set of lighting and flow requirements. For the most
                part, these corals require low to medium light, and low to medium flow. Their par requirements 
                range anywhere from 50 to 200 par depending on the coral. The placement of these corals 
                should generally be in the middle to lower portion of the tank. However, if you are intentionally
                running your lights at a lower intensity, then you can keep these corals at the top of the rock scape.
            </p>
        </header>
            <section class="left">
                <h4>Euphyllia and Fimbriaphyllia</h4>
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbkjfefGpGM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                    These corals, called torch coral, frogspawn coral, and hammer coral, have similar care requirements.
                    They require medium light in the 80 to 200 par. To keep them in higher light you must acclimate them
                    over time by moving them higher up in the tank. They require medium to low indirect flow. These are 
                    corals that extend and flow and providing too much flow to them could damage their tissue.
                </p>

                <h4>Chalice and Favia/Favites</h4>
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-D0WnU8-wZA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                    Chalice, Favia, and Favites corals all have a way of growing. They will grow and attach to 
                    the rock, which is called encrusting. These corals require medium or low light, 50 to 150 par, 
                    and medium to low flow. Again, we do not want to blow the flesh off of these corals, but enough 
                    to prevent debris from settling on them.

            <h2>Soft Coral</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Soft coral are much different from SPS and LPS corals. These corals do not have or grow a skeleton,
                hence their name <i>soft</i> corals. For the most part, these corals can thrive in a wide range of 
                conditions. Most of these corals are grouped into a beginner friendly section as they are fairly
                hardy.
            </p>

            <section class="left">
                <h4>Zoanthids and Palythoas</h4>
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyhRuk74kyA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                    Zoanthids and palythoas are very easy corals to keep. These corals can 
                    be kept in low to high light 50 to 200+ par, and in medium flow. They do not like to have lower 
                    flow because it allows debris and detritus to settle on their flesh. They can be placed on the rock 
                    work, or in the sand. It is best to keep them on a separated 
                    island or rock from the main rock structure to prevent them from growing too quickly. Please be careful and 
                    use gloves/eye protection when moving these corals because they can contain a potent neurological 
                    toxin. Use activated carbon in your filtration to neutralize any possible toxin in the water.
                </p>

                <h4>Mushrooms</h4>
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhJveMjLfoQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                    Similar to zoanthid and palythoa corals, mushrooms can be kept in a fairly wide variety of conditions.
                    However, these corals are a little more difficult to care for. They should be kept in low light, between
                    30 and 70 par, and should be kept in very low flow. Still low enough that detritus does not settle on them
                    but not much more than that. These corals are similar to anemones in that they can 'walk' to find a place 
                    more suitable to them. However, they do so very very slowly and are more likely to detach from any substrate
                    rather than move.
