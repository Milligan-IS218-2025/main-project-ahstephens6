            <h2>Tank</h2>
            <p>
                So, what kind of tank is right for you? I would suggest something
                between 40 and 75 gallons for a first tank. This is large enough
                to maintain stability easily and is still mostly budget friendly.
                If you choose to do an all in one system, where the filtration is
                in the back of the tank, or a reef ready system (recommended), with a separate sump
                underneath the tank, it does not matter. With a tank this size you will
                also need to get a stand that fit the footprint of the tank.
            </p>

            <h2>Filtration</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you have a tank (and possibly stand) picked out, you need
                some method for filtering the water. If you decided to get an all in
                one system you may be more limited in the type of filtration you can
                do. With a reef ready system, I would recommend getting an appropriately
                sized skimmer for the total water volume of the system. I would also recommend
                filter socks or filter rollers to pull large particulate out of the water.
                For an all in one system, it would be best to get filter socks and plenty of
                bio-media for increasing the total surface area inside of the tank.
                There are several additional filtration tools/methods you can use to
                filter your tank that I will not discuss on this website. These are
                the simplest types of filtration and get the best results for the
                amount of effort.

            <h2>Temperature Control</h2>
            <p>
                Depending on the climate of your area and/or the normal temperature range
                of your house, you will need an appropriately sized heater. Depending on
                how hot your house gets in the summer months, you may also want to invest
                in a chiller. More about temperature will be discussed in the <em>Chemistry</em>
                section of the website.
            </p>

            <h2>Pumps and Power Heads</h2>
            <p>
                What I would recommend for a pump is something that is controllable. You want
                to be able to adjust the amount of flow that you are running in your tank to
                ensure proper filtration and flow through the sump. The size of the
                pump should fit inside of the sump and provide about 5-10 times the total water
                volume of the display per hour. For example, if you have a 40 gallon tank, a
                pump between 200 gallons per hour and 400 gallons per hour. The more flow is not
                always better, however the ability to provide more if needed is definitely better.
                If you have an all in one tank, you may not have the ability to adjust pump flow,
                but that is ok.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a power head, I would recommend anything that can provide steady and gentle flow as
                apposed to forceful flow. This will require some fiddling with to get right. The same
                standard applies to power heads, the ability to provide more flow is better, but running
                it at a lower flow rate will be better. I would recommend an EcoTech Marine MP10 or MP40 or a
                Maxspect Gyre (smaller model). Any one of these power heads would be good for providing
                extra flow within the tank, and have controllability that makes it suitable for your system.

            <h2>Lighting</h2>
            <p>
                Lighting is a loaded subject, and therefore I will be broad in what light you should choose.
                For the most part, a light that will do best is one that has a wide spread. You are not looking
                for a light that casts a narrow beam because you want shadows to be covered. I recommend getting
                either AquaIllumination hydra series or blades, or EcoTech Marine Radion lights. If your tank is
                longer than 2 feet I would recommend getting more than 1 light. This will allow you to create a
                bright and well lit space for corals to thrive.
            </p>

            <h2>Rock and Sand</h2>
            <p>
                Rock and sand are part of a larger conversation about biome and bacterial filtration,
                but for simplicity, I will recommend getting completely dry rock, and live sand. The general
                rule of thumb for the amount of rock to get is a few pounds more than the number of gallons in
                the display. Therefore, if you get a 40 gallon tank, you should get 45-50 pounds of rock. It can
                be a mixture of reef shaped rock, or base rock to sit on the bottom, or shelf rock to provide a
                flat space for corals. You can assemble the rocks into an aquascape either by stacking the rocks
                on each other, or gluing and epoxying them together. If you choose to glue them together,
                use a fast setting cyanoacrylate glue with a setting spray, and then mortar to set the rock
                permanently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sand is not too difficult to figure out, however, what I recommend is figuring out what kind
                of tank you want to have first. If you want a fish only tank, you could go with any type of sand.
                If you wanted to do a lower flow lower light coral tank, then I would recommend medium to small grain
                size sand. If you have fish that will burrow or sift in the sand you will want medium sized sand.
                I will go more in depth into the animals in the fish and corals section of this website, so this I
                would simply recommend getting CaribSea Special grade sand. This is a live sand with beneficial bacteria
                at a good size for many conditions. I would also recommend having a sand bed between 2 and 3 inches
                deep.
                This will provide a lot of surface area for bacteria.

            <h2>Water Testing</h2>
            <p>
                There are a few test kits you will need for ensuring the water quality is good. Most hobby grade
                test kits are good enough to get started with and be close enough, but if you choose to get more
                accurate kits that is up to you. I would recommend being able to test ammonia, nitrite, nitrate,
                phosphate, pH, calcium, alkalinity, and magnesium. Ammonia and nitrite do not need to be tested
                frequently except for during the cycle (more about the cycle on the Chemistry tab).

            <h2>Water Changes</h2>
            <p>
                For water changes, you will need salt mix to make water and purified water. I recommend getting
                water from a local fish store (lfs) or purifying your own water with a reverse osmosis and
                deionization machine (RODI). You will need a 5 gallon or larger bucket to mix the water in, as well
                as a refractometer to ensure the salinity of the water is correct. In oder to get water out of the
                tank, you can either scoop it out, or siphon it out. I recommend getting a sand/gravel vacuum. This
                way you can vacuum the sand as well as remove water at the same time.
