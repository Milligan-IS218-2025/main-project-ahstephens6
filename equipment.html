            <h2>Tank</h2>
            <p>
                So, what kind of tank is right for you? I would suggest something
                between 40 and 75 gallons for a first tank. This is large enough
                to maintain stability easily and is still mostly budget friendly.
                If you choose to do an all in one system, where the filtration is 
                in the back of the tank, or a reef ready system (recommended), with a separate sump
                underneath the tank, it does not matter. With a tank this size you will
                also need to get a stand that fit the footprint of the tank.

            <h2>Filtration</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you have a tank (and possibly stand) picked out, you need 
                some method for filtering the water. If you decided to get an all in 
                one system you may be more limited in the type of filtration you can 
                do. With a reef ready system, I would recommend getting an appropriately
                sized skimmer for the total water volume of the system. I would also recommend
                filter socks or filter rollers to pull large particulate out of the water.
                For an all in one system, it would be best to get filter socks and plenty of
                bio-media for increasing the total surface area inside of the tank. 
                There are several additional filtration tools/methods you can use to 
                filter your tank that I will not discuss on this website. These are
                the simplest types of filtration and get the best results for the 
                amount of effort.

            <h2>Temperature Control</h2>
            <p>
                Depending on the climate of your area and/or the normal temperature range
                of your house, you will need an appropriately sized heater. Depending on
                how hot your house gets in the summer months, you may also want to invest
                in a chiller. More about temperature will be discussed in the <em>Chemistry</em>
                section of the website.
