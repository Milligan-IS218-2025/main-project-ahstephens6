            <h2>Putting it Together</h2>
            <p>
                Once you have collected all of the required equipment for your tank, you need to assemble it.
                Start with finding a location to setup your tank.
                You will want to ensure that the tank is on a stable and supported surface because of the weight once filled.
                If you want to build your rock work out ahead of time, you should do so now and place the finished pieces into the tank.
                Place the sand in the bottom of the tank and spread it as evenly as possible.
                Add any power heads to the side of the tank pointing towards the open parts of the water and not directly at the rocks.
                Finally you will add saltwater mixed to 35 ppt salinity to fill the tank.
            </p>

            <h2>The Cycle</h2>
            <p>
                Once the tank has water in it you will want to begin the cycle.
                This refers to the nitrogen cycle, where you build up beneficial bacteria to break down nitrogen in your tank.
                I recommend using <em>Dr. Tim's One and Only Live Nitrifying Bacteria</em> to jump-start the process.
                You will probably need to add a little bit of food as a nitrogen source for the bacteria.
                You will need to measure your ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate through this process.
                You are looking for each element to be slightly above 0, and if you notice that any one number stops going down you should do a water change.
                Ammonia and nitrite should decrease, and nitrate should increase.
                If ammonia or nitrite are at 0 you may have to add more food to give the bacteria more food supply.
                You will know when the cycle is complete when you add more food into the tank and ammonia and nitrite are undetectable.

            <h2>Finishing Touches</h2>
            <p>
                Once the cycle is complete, you can slowly add fish and coral to your tank.
                You will want to get an assortment of snails and hermit crabs to eat the algae that will grow on the rocks and glass.
                You will also want to hang and turn on your lights.
                I recommend starting with the lights low and working them up to get the tank used to light.
                There will also be a point in which a lot of algae will most likely grow.
                This is called the ugly stage of setting up a tank, and will resolve itself over time and with a little bit of maintenance.
            </p>

            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <p>
                Once the tank is set up you will need to perform weekly maintenance.
                This involves changing the water, vacuuming some of the sand bed, and cleaning the glass.
                It is also good to test water chemistry weekly to ensure that the levels remain within acceptable ranges.
                All that is left to do is enjoy!
