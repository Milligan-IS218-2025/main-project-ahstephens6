            This is the final project for my Web Development class. I am going to develop a
            webpage that explores setting up/owning and taking care of a saltwater fish tank.

            This is a somewhat complex hobby that can be broken down into a few major points
            that I will cover in other parts of this website. I think that this would be a useful guide 
            for anyone that wants to try keeping saltwater aquariums. It could also be used as a
            cheetsheet for general information regarding aquarium startups.
